// let keyword  came into existance in ES2015
// declare variables with var can also be done with let

let a = "Amit";
var b = "jay";
console.log(a);
console.log(b);

//good practice to use let for declaring variables
//difference is var can be overidden but let cant be overidden

//example

var q =1;
var q = 2;
console.log(q);

let q = 3;
// let q = 4; will give us error
